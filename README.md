Work day schedule

The purpose of the work day scheduler was to allow the user to set the days work schedule and to give them an indication of when the time has been past, just been reached or is coming up in the future so as to keep up with the work day.

I used a .each function in order to get the work day scheduler to show specific colours depending on whether the time was past, just been reached or was coming up. I then used multiple .click and .each functions in order to apply the saving and clearing local storage to each save and clear button.
